# AK2W Satellite Antenna System


**Project Start: 10-29-2021**  
**Project Completion: 3-8-2022**  
**James H. Baxter - AK2W**  

## Introduction
It has long been a dream of my adult life to build an amateur radio station capable of HF and VHF/UHF and
satellite operation â€“ including a cross-Yagi 146 and 435 MHz antenna system on azimuth/elevation rotators to
work amateur satellites.  

This year I completed designing and building such an antenna system - this repository contains a record of this journey.  

## Project Files

**Designing Cross-Yagi Antennas for Working Amateur Satellites.pdf** is a record of the research, design, and build process including parts lists, images, and descriptions for each part of the process. Notes on working through amateur satellites are provided at the end of the document.  

**AK2W Crossed Yagi Antenna Design Calculations 2022.xlsx** is a spreadsheet that captures the output of the EZNEC models and Yagi Calculator for 146 MHz and 435 MHz cross-Yagi antennas, including a page containing the summarized build specs (element lengths and boom placements) for each antenna.  

The **EZNEC** folder contains the final (version 3) EZNEC model files for both antennas.  
The **images** folder contains all the images used in the PDF as well as a lot of others that may be useful for understanding how the antennas were built.
